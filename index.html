			<h1>About Pomeranian dogs</h1>

		<hr>
		<div class="card">
			<p>The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania
				region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because
				of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German
				Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German
				Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz ("Dwarf Spitz").
				The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned
				a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular.
				During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. Overall, the Pomeranian
				is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More
				rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin condition colloquially known as "black skin disease". This
				is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair. As of
				2017, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty
				most popular breeds in the United States, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their
				popularity worldwide.</p>
			<h2>Appearance</h2>

			<p>Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14 inches (20–36 cm)
				high at the withers.[2] They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly
				plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known
				for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.
				The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a
				small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th
				century.
				In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white,
				black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and
				parti, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black, or cream/white.</p>
			<h3>Behavior</h3>
			<p>Pomeranians are typically friendly, lively and playful.
				They can be aggressive with other dogs and humans to try to prove themselves.Pomeranians are alert and
				aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking
				excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they
				hear outside noises.
				Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they
				want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, but they can
				become dominant, willful and stubborn if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an
				effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.</p>

Prior to starting training a Pomeranian dog – If a Pomeranian doesn’t 
fully 
	understand 
		the basics, 
			then it’s essential for him 
				to go through basic Pomeranian obedience 
				  	training.

				<dt>SHAKING A PAW (ONE OR BOTH)</dt>
				<dd>Everybody loves this Pomeranian dog training trick, whether family, friends or strangers. Your Pom
					will feel great because he’ll get a LOT of attention just by shaking your hand. The aim is for him
					to lift his paw to the height of his chest so you can shake his paw. He should be able to do it with
					either paw.
				</dd>
				<dt>LEASH TRAINING</dt>
				<dd> Training a puppy to walk on a leash is very important, especially in suburban and urban areas where
					traffic can be a problem. Many small dogs, including Pomeranians, don’t work well with a collar and
					leash. It’s often best to use a harness and leash to keep from injuring their neck or shoulders. It
					should be a slow process reinforced with treats, just as all of the other training has been.</dd>
